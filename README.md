Flow is a word game similar to the famously brilliant Wordle.

Flow includes a similar small dictionary of words to Wordle,
but the big difference with Flow is that you can ask for a
clue at any time in the game and\or see the meaning to most
revealed words.

Better still, if you are good with words, and I'm talking Scrabble
type crazy words, then you can use the huge hard dictionary of over
90k words it does also include the 23k easy words. .

To the best of my ability and knowledge 
I have removed all of the 'bad' words from the dictionaries, I  even
enlisted the help of A.I (chatGTP) to search for and remove anything
even remotely offensive, but I'm sure there's a few in there that
will offend someone somewhere, but I hope not,
this is a fun game for all ages.


There is also a game log\history that keeps a record of every game
that you play, it records the outcome, how many guesses it took you,
the secret word, its meaning, wether you used a clue or not and the
date-time of the game.

Note: To change dictionaries restart the program and choose at the start up.


How To Play FLOW:

1: On running the game you will be asked if you want to use the default  
   "Easy dictionary", (see discussion above) answer yes if you do, or
   no if you want to use the hard dictionary.

2: Once the game has started either click on "Give Me A Clue"
   or take a wild guess at a 5 lettered word by clicking on the letters 
   on the on-screen virtual keyboard to create a 5 lettered valid word.
   Click "Ent" to play that word.

3: If you mis-spell, or change your mind before you click Ent,
   you go back using the "Del" key.(before clicking Ent though)
   Or if your word is rejected as invalid then use "Del"
   to delete each letter.

4: if you guess the secret word correctly you will be offered to
   see the meaning of the word or not, your game history will
   be updated and a new game will be offered to you.

5: If you do not guess the full word correctly, you may see some
   letters of your word are coloured in green or yellow, or not at all.

6: If a letter of your guessed word is green it means the letter is
   part of the word and is in the correct position of the word.

7: A yellow letter means the letter is in the secret word but is 
   not in the correct position.

8: If any letters are not coloured either green or yellow they are not
   in the secret word and can be discounted.

9. Can you can use this information to logically work out the secret word?

10: You have six attempts. Use "Give Me A Clue" if you get stuck.

Note: The catch is you can't just slap any old letters in at random,
      you can only enter real words, and those words must be in the
	  game's current dictionary, sometimes what seems a perfectly 
	  valid word is not in the game dictionary for some reason!
	

Good luck, and just go with the FLOW people.
